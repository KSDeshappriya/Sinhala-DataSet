# Sinhala Biggest Dataset Project: Empowering Sinhala AI

> [සිංහලෙන් README](SINHALA.md)

This project aims to create the **largest publicly available Sinhala dataset**, paving the way for the development of robust and accurate Sinhala AI models. 

## **Why This Project is Important:**

* **Limited Sinhala Data:** Currently, there's a significant lack of publicly available high-quality Sinhala datasets, hindering the progress of Sinhala AI research and development.
* **Boosting Sinhala AI:** A vast and diverse dataset will enable the creation of powerful Sinhala AI models for various applications, including:
    * **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Machine translation, text summarization, sentiment analysis, chatbot development.
    * **Computer Vision:** Image recognition, object detection, scene understanding.
    * **Speech Recognition:** Automatic speech recognition, voice assistants.
* **Promoting Sinhala Language:** By empowering Sinhala AI, this project contributes to the preservation and growth of the Sinhala language in the digital age.

## **Project Objectives:**

* **Collect and Curate Data:** Gather a wide variety of Sinhala text data sources.
* **Preprocess and Annotate:** Clean, format, and annotate the data for specific AI tasks.
* **Release Publicly:** Make the dataset freely accessible to the research community and developers.
* **Foster Collaboration:** Encourage collaboration and contributions from individuals and organizations to further enrich the dataset.

## **How You Can Contribute:**

* **Data Donation:** Contribute your own Sinhala data, ensuring it adheres to ethical guidelines.
* **Preprocessing and Annotation:** Help clean, format, and annotate the data.
* **Code Development:** Contribute to the project's codebase for data management, preprocessing, and annotation tools.
* **Spread the Word:** Share information about the project and encourage others to participate.

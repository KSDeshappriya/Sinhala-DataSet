## ත්‍රිපිටක (Tipitaka) Sinhala Dataset for AI Models

This repository contains a curated data extract from the [Tipitaka.lk](https://github.com/pathnirvana/tipitaka.lk.git) project, specifically designed to create a comprehensive Sinhala dataset for training AI models.

The Tripitaka, also known as the Pali Canon, is a rich collection of Buddhist scriptures written in Pali.  This dataset focuses on the **Sinhala translation** of the Tripitaka, providing a vast resource for:

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks:** Language modeling, text classification, machine translation, and more.
* **Developing AI models that understand and process Sinhala text.**
* **Research on Sinhala language and Buddhist literature.**

**Key Features:**

* **Extensive and Cleaned Data:** The dataset contains a large corpus of Sinhala text extracted from the Tripitaka, cleaned and preprocessed for optimal AI model training.
* **Structured Format:**  The data is organized in a structured format, making it easy to use for various AI projects.
* **Metadata:**  Provides essential information about each text, including the source, chapter, and author, for context and analysis.

**Contributing to the Project:**

This dataset is a valuable resource for the Sinhala NLP community. We encourage contributions to improve its quality and usefulness:

* **Report Errors:** If you identify any errors or issues with the data, please report them through GitHub Issues.
* **Suggest Improvements:**  Share your ideas for enhancing the dataset, including potential new features or data additions.
* **Contribute to the Project:**  If you have the expertise, consider contributing code or documentation to help maintain and grow this valuable resource.
